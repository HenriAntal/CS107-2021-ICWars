###Conception

We wanted to create something special, so we thought thoroughly what we can
do even though we didn't finish the whole project. We came to the conclusion that we 
want to create a new action. Our idea was to do something creative but also not too difficult
to execute. We thought about creating a timer for each RealPlayer, so you would only
have a limited time to do your moves. We tried many approaches but nothing worked. We
didn't want to give up and created the ``(P)eace`` Action. Instead of letting the Unit just wait a round 
we gave it another option. It can take a peaceful dump on its position and can wait for 
the next round. All one has to do, is click on `P` when in the action menu and the magic
begins. Thank you for playing our game and for reading through our work!

Best Regards `FLU` and `ANTAL`

we should put all infos that we gather during programming in here so we can just create a pdf at the end and copy the stuff in.

Classes which are described in the text have been created.


Stuff we still need to add a List:
  - UnitList
  - Damage and Healing for Units
  - Player loses when UnitList is empty of Ally or Enemy
  - Create the red line with the border!

### Goal

- The goal of this game is to beat your opponent by using your units and defeating his units. In your arsenal you have soldiers and tanks.

```
    Soldier -   Low range and low damage.
    
    Tank    -   High range and high damage.
```

- Once you've destroyed all his units you win. If this is the case, you go to the next level. Otherwise, you have to restart
the level. 


### Navigation
###### Essentials

- You move your cursor with the arrow-keys (```↑ ↓ ← →```).

- You can select one of your units with the ```Enter``` key. (Deselecting happens with the ```Tab``` key.)

- Once you have picked your unit, you will see the range they have. You can move the unit anywhere in the white space.

- When pressing ```Enter``` again you move your Unit to the position where your cursor is appearing.

- To attack you will need to select an enemy unit with the left and right arrow keys (```← →```).

- Once selected you can either wait ```W``` or attack ```A```.

- It is either the opponents turn when you have used all of your units in one turn or when 
you press ```Tab``` in the mode where you can move around freely.


###### Extra

- With the ```N``` Key you can skip to the next level, if you are in the last level the game closes.
- With the ```R``` Key you can restart the game.


### General

Some general information about the game:
- You are always the starting player.
- There are game rounds and player rounds.
- In the player round you can move your units and attack with them
- Once every player has made their turn the round ends, and it begins again with the first player playing his round.
- If a player doesn't have any units left he will be removed from the game.
- The player that survives in the end is the winner.

### Strategies

- Keeping the Tank alive is one of the most important strategies, so you can make use of his high attack damage
as long as possible.

- Keeping in mind how far the opponent can move in the next round is a strategy used by pro-players.

- Never play with a pattern, try to change up your strategies, so it gets more difficult for your opponent to 
read your upcoming moves.

- In ICWars the motto is also: "No Pain, No Gain", the more you play the better you will get.

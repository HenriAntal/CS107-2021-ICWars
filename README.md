### Goal

- The Goal of this game is to beat your opponent by using your Units and defeating his Units. In your arsenal you have Soldiers and Tanks.


    Soldier -   Low range and low damage.
    
    Tank    -   High range and high damage.


- Once you've destroyed all of his Units you win. And you can therefore go to the next Level. If you lose, you have to repeat
the Level. 


### Navigation
###### Essentials

- You move your cursor with the arrow-keys (```↑ ↓ ← →```).

- You can select one of your units with the ```Enter``` Key. (Deselecting happens with the ```Tab``` key.)

- Once you have picked your unit, you then see the range they have. You can move the unit anywhere in the white space.

- When pressing ```Enter``` again you move your Unit to the position where your cursor is appearing.

- To attack you will need to select an enemy unit with the left and right arrow key (```← →```).

- Once selected you can either wait ```W``` or attack ```A```.

- It is either the opponents turn when you have used all of your units in one turn or when 
you press ```Tab``` in the mode where you can move around freely.


###### Extra

- With the ```N``` Key you can skip to the next level.
- With the ```R``` Key you can restart the game.


### Strategies

- Keeping the Tank alive is one of the most important strategies, so you can make use of his high attack damage
as long as possible.

- Keeping in mind how far the opponent can move in the next round is a strategy used by pro-players.

- Never play with a pattern, try to change up your strategies so it gets more difficult for your opponent to 
calculate your upcoming moves.

- In ICWars the motto is also: "No Pain, No Gain", the more you play the better you will get.

###Goal

The Goal of this Game is to beat your Opponent by using your Units and defeating
his Units. In your arsenal you have Soldiers and Tanks. 

    Soldier -   Low Range and low damage.
    
    Tank -      High Range and high damage.
The Tanks have a lot of range 
and deal way more damage

we should put all infos that we gather during programming in here so we can just create a pdf at the end and copy the stuff in.

Classes which are described in the text have been created.


Stuff we still need to add a List:
  - UnitList
  - Damage and Healing for Units
  - Player loses when UnitList is empty of Ally or Enemy
  - Create the red line with the border!
